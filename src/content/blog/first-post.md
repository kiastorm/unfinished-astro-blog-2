## Introduction

As applications, teams and organisations grow in size and complexity, the need for modular assets, composable that simplify the production of new features and the maintenance of existing ones becomes increasingly important. Composable components with clear and intuitive APIs make it easier for team members to understand and reuse each other's code, resulting in more consistent and reliable user and developer experiences.

This post will explore the use of context, hooks, and prop getters, along with other techniques, in writing composable code to improve the quality of your codebases and output of your teams, resulting in better user experiences.

## Composable Components with React

Modular, composable code enables developers to break down complex interfaces into manageable pieces that can be easily understood, modified, and reused. The more composable a component is, the more easily it can be integrated into different parts of an applications in conjunction with other components.

### Composition patterns for UI components

React provides several patterns to achieve composability in UI components. These patterns enable developers to share and reuse component logic, styles, and state across different parts of an application:

Higher-order components (HOCs): HOCs are functions that accept a component as an input and return a new component with additional props or behavior. HOCs allow developers to reuse logic across multiple components without duplicating code.

Render props: The render props pattern involves passing a function as a prop to a component, which is then responsible for rendering part of the UI. This pattern enables the sharing of state and logic between components while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

Compound components: Compound components are a group of components designed to work together, often sharing implicit state through the use of React's Context API. This pattern encourages a clear and flexible API for assembling complex components from smaller, focused pieces.

### Benefits and best practices for creating composable components

Embracing composability in React components offers numerous benefits, including simplified maintenance, increased code reusability, and improved flexibility. By adhering to the following best practices, developers can create composable components that enhance the overall architecture of their applications:

Favor small, focused components: Break down complex components into smaller, more manageable pieces with a single responsibility. This approach makes it easier to understand, test, and reuse components across different parts of the application.

Use composition patterns where appropriate: Select the most suitable composition pattern (HOCs, render props, or compound components) based on the use case and desired flexibility.

Encapsulate component state and logic: Keep state and logic within components or custom hooks to promote reusability and maintain separation of concerns.

Provide clear and intuitive component APIs: Design component APIs that are easy to understand, use, and compose. Consistent prop naming conventions and well-defined propTypes can significantly improve the usability of a component.
